## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Choose Your Doom**: Select Easy 🌱, Medium 🔥, or Hard 💀
2. **Spread Orbs**: Click empty cells or your own orbs to add more
3. **Trigger Chaos**: When orbs reach critical mass (4), they explode! 💥
4. **Chain Reactions**: Explosions spread to neighboring cells in glorious mayhem
5. **Rule or Die**: Eliminate all enemy orbs... or spread 'til dead! ⛓️

## 🎮 Game Rules

- Each cell has a critical mass of 4 orbs
- When a cell reaches critical mass, it explodes and spreads orbs to adjacent cells
- Explosions can trigger chain reactions (the fun part!)
- You can only place orbs in empty cells or cells you own
- The game ends when one player has no orbs remaining
- **Remember**: Chain it. Break it. Rule it. 💀
